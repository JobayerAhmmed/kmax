Kmax uses both BDDs (as described in the original paper) and a Z3 solver.  Z3 performs better when constructing the logical formulas, but slower when checking satisfiability than BDDs.  Z3 is best for displaying the resulting formula, since it doesn't require the exhaustive enumeration of the BDD, and BDD is best for checking the (un)satisfiability of formulas, which Kmax uses to trim infeasible states during analysis.
